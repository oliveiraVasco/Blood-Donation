# Blood Donation
This project is an approach to DrivenData's [blood donation challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/). It's used R to perform the following tasks: Data cleaning and normalisation; Random sampling; Neural network fitting (using neuralnet package); Log loss computation; Neural network multi-node/layer analysis (based on Log loss in and out of sample); Parallel computing of random sample multi-node/layer analysis.
